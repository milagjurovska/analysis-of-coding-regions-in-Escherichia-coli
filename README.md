# Fourrier Transformations in Genomics
This project was made for the subject Engineering Mathematics, where the main uses for the Fourrier Transformations in Genomics is discussed.

## Analysis of the coding regions in Escherichia coli using RStudios
A short code in R testing whether the DNA sequence in Escherichia coli, with the sample taken from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), is a coding region, by using the three-base periodicity property.

The image above shows the result of the code, where the red line is the frequency at 1/3, and there is a peak right at the line, so this tells us that there might be a coding region in this section of the DNA sequence of Escherichia coli.
